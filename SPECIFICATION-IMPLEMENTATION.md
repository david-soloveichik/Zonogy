# Implementation Details

## Destroyed Window Detection

Not all applications emit didTerminateApplication notification upon closing (eg Find My). So we need to also monitor other notifications. Specifically, we do the following:

After events such as application termination, workspace focus changes, or accessibility notifications, `AppController` validates every affected PID. An external window is removed immediately when either the window server stops reporting its `CGWindowNumber` or the accessibility element returns an invalid-element error. If the initial pass finds no destroyed windows but the PID still owns managed windows, the controller schedules a short series of PID-scoped revalidations with exponential backoff (≈0.2 s → 3.2 s). Retries cancel as soon as every window disappears or the process exits; no global polling timer runs.

## Temporary Zone Protection Windows

When a window is placed in the temporary zone, it receives a 1-second protection window during which focus-shift events will not minimize it. If a spurious focus event occurs during this window (e.g., macOS activating a sibling window after the displaced occupant is minimized), the temporary zone occupant is reactivated to maintain the invariant that it remains the active window. This prevents a newly placed window from being immediately dismissed.

The same protection mechanism applies when restoring layouts from sleep/wake recovery or WinShot snapshots, so that internal restore operations do not fight normal layout behavior.

For ActiveFit candidate zones during restore, we temporarily suppress ActiveFit during the restore layout pass and then evaluate it once for the active window after the restore settles.

## Additional Notes

- `window_id`s should be monotonically increasing so logs stay unique; do not recycle identifiers after a window closes.
- When `NSWorkspace` reports that an application terminated, immediately drop every managed window for that pid and resync so placeholders reappear in vacated zones.
- We add a simple logging utility (e.g., `Logger.debug(_:)`) used by controllers so we can trace zone transitions and window lifecycle without attaching Xcode.
**Log monitoring tip:** To watch the live log output, run:
`swift run 2>&1 | grep --line-buffered "keyword"`.
- **Notification suppression:** When Zonogy programmatically minimizes specific windows (e.g., bulk clear/reset, displacement, startup pruning), it suppresses only the *next* `AXWindowMiniaturized` notification for those window IDs (one-shot) with a safety timeout (~3s). When restoring WinShot snapshots, it also suppresses only the *next* `AXWindowDeminiaturized` notification for the restored external windows that are being unminimized and pre-positioned as part of the snapshot. Other windows remain unaffected and user-triggered actions still get through.
(`grep --line-buffered` streams matching lines without delay.)

## Accessibility API Workarounds

### Retry Mechanisms Tied to Accessibility

Zonogy uses three narrowly scoped retry mechanisms to cope with AX timing and consistency issues: two are PID/application-scoped and one is per window. All of them are tied to concrete events (no global polling loops) and are explicitly cancelled when they are no longer needed or when the system goes to sleep.

- **(Per-application) destroyed-window validation retries (PID-scoped):** After AX-relevant lifecycle events (window focus changes, application activation/deactivation/hide, screen-topology changes), `ValidationRetryManager` schedules a short series of PID-scoped validation passes (≈0.2–3.2s backoff) when AX-based destroyed-window detection is inconclusive. These retries are cancelled when the process exits, when all windows are pruned, or when screens go to sleep (`handleScreensDidSleep` calls `cancelAllValidationRetries()`). See also "Destroyed Window Detection" above for a fuller description of this pipeline.
- **(Per-application) AX window-capture retries (PID-scoped):** When `AXWindowCreated` notifications fail to yield a manageable window (e.g., transient AX errors), `WindowCapturePipeline` schedules a small number of delayed recapture attempts per PID using `cancelAllRetries()` to tear them down when captures succeed, the app exits, or the system goes to sleep.
- **(Per-window) AX frame application retries:** When applying a zone-aligned frame via AX leaves a window off-screen or far from the requested geometry, `WindowController` schedules a one-shot delayed frame retry for that window. These per-window timers are cancelled whenever zone topology/geometry changes or when screens go to sleep so no stale frame targets are applied later.

### User vs programmatic move/resize attribution

AX move/resize notifications (`kAXMovedNotification`, `kAXResizedNotification`) do not indicate whether the change was triggered by:

- the user (dragging the window or its resize handles),
- the application itself (internal panels, layout updates), or
- Zonogy (zone alignment, restores, pre-positioning).

Zonogy handles this with two complementary mechanisms:

- **Programmatic-update suppression:** When Zonogy resizes a window, `WindowController` tags that window as "programmatic" for a short time and ignores the resulting AX moved/resized notifications. This prevents feedback loops where reacting to our own move/resize would cause additional move/resize attempts.
- **Gesture heuristics for non-programmatic AX events:**
  - **Moves / drags:** An AXMoved burst is treated as a user drag only if the left mouse button is down and the pointer moves beyond a small activation threshold. Drag end is detected via mouse-up monitoring. This avoids treating incidental or app-driven moves as a drag-and-drop gesture.
  - **Resizes:** For most apps, any non-programmatic AXResized is treated as a completed manual resize and the window is marked "detached" until focus loss or the next layout sync. For apps that opt into `snapToZoneOnSelfResize`, Zonogy attempts to recognize user edge-drag resizes (cursor near the window border plus left-mouse down or a very recent mouse-up grace window).

This attribution work is used by:

- the drag-and-drop pipeline for moving windows between zones (showing overlays, choosing drop targets, finalizing on mouse-up),
- deferring placement during tab tear-out flows while the user is mid-drag,
- manual resize detachment + snapback on focus loss/layout sync, and
- app-specific self-resize snap-to-zone behavior (e.g., Zoom panels) without fighting deliberate user resizes.

### Window subrole for minimized windows

Some applications report the subrole for their minimized windows as AXDialogSubrole even if it later becomes kAXStandardWindowSubrole upon un-minimization. So for enumeration of windows to manage, we don't check subrole for minimized windows.

### Async unminimize after pre-positioning ("pre-move" feature)

When unminimizing a window that needs to appear at a specific position (e.g., restoring a WinShot snapshot or selecting a minimized window from Launcher), we first set the window's position and size while the window is still minimized. However, if we unminimize synchronously right after setting position/size, the window sometimes visually appears at its old location before snapping to the correct position. To address this, we default to async mode for unminimization.

### Dock click interception activation workaround

When Zonogy intercepts a Dock left-click, the managed window we bring up may appear but fail to receive focus. The workaround that seems to work is to call `NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)` before performing the window action. This makes Zonogy the active app, removing focus from something else (and thus, presumably, allowing the managed window to become focused).
